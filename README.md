# Studentdatabase


An organized and systematic office solution is essential for all universities and organizations. There are many departments of administration for the maintenance of college information and student databases in any institution. All these departments provide various records regarding students. Most of these track records need to maintain information about the students. This information could be the general details like student name, address, performance, or specific information related to departments like collection of data. All the modules in college administration are interdependent. They are maintained manually. So they need to be automated and centralized as, Information from one module will be needed by other modules.

For example when a student needs his course completion certificate it needs to check many details about the student like his name, registration number, year of study, exams he attended and many other details. So it needs to contact all the modules that are office, department and examination and result of students. With that in mind, we overhauled the existing Student Database Management System and made necessary improvement to streamline the processes.
